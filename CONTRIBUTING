BALLS is my senior project.  As such, I cannot accept code contributions until after its final submission in May 2016.  Suggestions, bug reports, and the like are still welcome, but all actual work must be my own.

And, of course, you can still look at and modify the source code.  But I can't accept your changes right now.  Sorry.
